# TODO for Updating Model Training to 30 Epochs with Early Stopping

- [x] Update multi_modal_model.py to set num_epochs=30
- [x] Run multi-modal model training to verify changes
- [x] Analyze training output and metrics

## Analysis of Training Results (After Cleanup)

- **Training Completed**: Model trained for 16 epochs before early stopping (no improvement in validation accuracy for 3 epochs).
- **Dataset Size**: 1822 samples (balanced: 911 deceptive + 911 genuine).
- **Performance**:
  - Best Validation Accuracy: 96.71% at epoch 13.
  - Final Accuracy: 95.34%.
  - ROC-AUC: 98.12%.
  - Excellent classification for both classes (precision/recall >90%).
- **Training History**: Steady improvement from ~54% to 96.71%, with effective early stopping.
- **Conclusion**: Model is performing excellently on the available dataset. The cleanup may have resolved previous issues (possibly conflicting model files or cache problems).
