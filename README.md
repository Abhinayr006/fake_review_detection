# Fake Review Detection Project - Comprehensive Report

## Project Overview
This project implements a fake review detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify deceptive online reviews that may be written by bots, paid reviewers, or competitors to manipulate public opinion. We use two different approaches: a multi-modal deep learning model and a traditional Random Forest classifier.

## What is Fake Review Detection?
Fake review detection is a type of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning task where we analyze online reviews to determine if they are genuine (written by real customers) or deceptive (written with ulterior motives). This is important because fake reviews can mislead consumers and harm businesses.

## Data Sources

### Yelp Academic Dataset
We use the Yelp Academic Dataset, which is a large collection of real-world data from Yelp.com containing:
- **yelp_academic_dataset_review.json**: Contains millions of reviews with text, ratings (stars), dates, and user/business IDs
- **yelp_academic_dataset_user.json**: Contains user profile information including review history, ratings, social connections, and status

### Data Structure
Each review in the dataset contains:
- **text**: The actual review content
- **stars**: Rating from 1-5 stars
- **user_id**: Unique identifier for the reviewer
- **business_id**: Unique identifier for the business
- **date**: When the review was posted
- **useful**: Number of users who found the review useful
- **funny**: Number of users who found the review funny
- **cool**: Number of users who found the review cool

Each user profile contains:
- **user_id**: Unique user identifier
- **review_count**: Total number of reviews written by this user
- **average_stars**: User's average star rating across all reviews
- **elite**: Years the user had elite status (premium membership)
- **friends**: List of friend user IDs
- **fans**: Number of users who follow this user
- **compliments**: Various types of compliments received (hot, funny, cool, etc.)

## Data Preprocessing

### Step 1: Loading Data
We load a subset of 500,000 reviews from the review JSON file and all user data from the user JSON file.

### Step 2: Feature Extraction
We extract 7 behavioral features from the user data that help identify suspicious patterns:

1. **user_review_count**: Total number of reviews written by this user (from user.review_count)
2. **user_average_stars**: User's average star rating across all their reviews (from user.average_stars)
3. **is_elite**: Binary feature - 1 if user has elite status, 0 otherwise (derived from user.elite field)
4. **review_length**: Number of words in the current review text (calculated as len(text.split()))
5. **user_friends**: Number of friends this user has on Yelp (length of user.friends array)
6. **user_fans**: Number of fans/followers this user has (from user.fans)
7. **user_compliment_count**: Total compliments received (sum of all compliment types from user data)

### Step 3: Enhanced Labeling Reviews (Updated Heuristics)
We use advanced heuristic rules with 8 categories to label reviews as deceptive or genuine, significantly increasing deceptive samples from ~0.18% to ~28.38%:

#### Deceptive Categories:
1. **Suspiciously Repetitive or Extreme Language**: Reviews with repetitive positive words ("awesome", "amazing", "perfect", "love it so much", "highly recommend", "must buy again") with high stars (≥4)
2. **Excessive Use of First-Person or Over-Promotion**: Reviews containing phrases like "i am a big fan", "trust me", "guaranteed", "don't miss this", "best brand" with high stars (≥4)
3. **Very Short or Overly Generic Text**: Reviews with less than 5 words OR generic single words like "good", "nice", "great", "ok" (any rating)
4. **Time-Based Pattern**: Reviews posted at the same date with identical text patterns (duplicate reviews)
5. **Unnatural Punctuation or Capitalization**: Excessive use of exclamation marks ("!!!") OR reviews written in ALL CAPS
6. **Neutral or Negative Sentiment with High Stars**: Reviews with negative sentiment (sentiment < 0) but high stars (≥4)
7. **Overly Negative or Aggressive Language with Low Stars**: Reviews with extreme negative words ("worst", "terrible", "trash", "never buy", "fake", "scam", "waste") with low stars (≤2)
8. **Extreme Repetition or Keyword Stuffing**: Excessive repetition of positive/negative words (count of "good"/"best"/"bad"/"worst" > 5 occurrences, any rating)

#### Genuine Reinforcement:
- Reviews with moderate length (>50 words), positive sentiment (>0.2), and moderate stars (2-4) are reinforced as genuine

### Step 4: Balancing Dataset
We create a balanced dataset by sampling equal numbers of deceptive and genuine reviews to avoid bias in training.

## Machine Learning Models

### Why We Chose These Specific Models

#### Model Selection Rationale
We implemented two complementary approaches to fake review detection:

1. **Multi-Modal Deep Learning (Primary)**: For state-of-the-art performance using both text and behavioral patterns
2. **Random Forest (Baseline)**: For interpretable, traditional ML comparison and robustness

#### Why DistilBERT Over Other Language Models?
- **Performance vs Speed Trade-off**: DistilBERT achieves 97% of BERT's performance with 60% fewer parameters
- **Resource Efficiency**: Faster training (11 min/epoch vs 20+ min for RoBERTa) and lower memory usage
- **Task Suitability**: Pre-trained on general language understanding, works well for classification tasks
- **Practical Results**: Achieved 87.26% accuracy in first epoch, surpassing human-level performance
- **Alternatives Considered**: RoBERTa (marginal 1-2% gain, 2x training time), ELECTRA (similar performance, more complex)

#### Why Random Forest as Secondary Model?
- **Interpretability**: Can explain which features influenced predictions (feature importance)
- **Robustness**: Less prone to overfitting than deep learning models
- **Speed**: Very fast training (2 minutes) and prediction
- **Complementary Strengths**: Catches different types of patterns than deep learning
- **Production Ready**: Simple deployment and maintenance

### Model 1: Multi-Modal Deep Learning Model

#### What is Multi-Modal Learning?
Multi-modal learning combines information from different types of data sources. Here we combine:
- **Text modality**: Review text processed by DistilBERT language model
- **Behavioral modality**: 7 numerical features about user behavior patterns

#### Architecture Details

**Text Encoder (DistilBERT)**:
- **Why DistilBERT**: Smaller, faster BERT variant with 66M parameters (vs BERT's 110M)
- **Function**: Converts review text into 768-dimensional contextual embeddings
- **Pooling**: Mean pooling across tokens for fixed-size review representation
- **Advantage**: Captures semantic meaning, context, and linguistic patterns

**Behavioral Encoder**:
- **Input**: 7 features (review_count, avg_stars, elite_status, review_length, friends, fans, compliments)
- **Architecture**: Linear(7) → GELU → Dropout(0.3) → Linear(256) → GELU → Dropout(0.3)
- **Purpose**: Learn complex patterns in user behavior that indicate suspicious activity

**Attention-Based Fusion**:
- **Mechanism**: 2-weight attention (text vs behavioral importance)
- **Benefit**: Model learns to weigh text and behavioral signals dynamically
- **Implementation**: Softmax attention weights applied before concatenation

**Final Classifier**:
- **Architecture**: Linear(1024) → GELU → Dropout(0.4) → Linear(512) → GELU → Dropout(0.3) → Linear(2)
- **Output**: Binary classification logits for genuine vs deceptive

**Key Hyperparameters**:
- **Learning Rate**: 2e-5 (optimal for transformers, prevents catastrophic forgetting)
- **Batch Size**: 16 (memory-efficient for GPU training)
- **Dropout**: 0.3-0.4 (prevents overfitting on behavioral features)
- **Early Stopping Patience**: 5 epochs (allows thorough training before stopping)
- **LR Scheduler**: ReduceLROnPlateau (factor=0.7, patience=3) for adaptive learning

#### Training Process
1. Load balanced dataset (54,690 samples from 100k reviews)
2. 80/20 train/validation split with stratification
3. Initialize DistilBERT (frozen base) + trainable fusion layers
4. Train for maximum 30 epochs with early stopping
5. AdamW optimizer with weight decay for regularization
6. Monitor validation accuracy for early stopping decisions

### Model 2: Random Forest Classifier

#### What is Random Forest?
Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees. Each tree votes on the prediction, and the majority vote wins.

#### How it Works
1. **Bootstrap Sampling**: Creates multiple subsets of the training data
2. **Feature Randomness**: Each tree only sees a random subset of features
3. **Voting**: Final prediction is the most common prediction across all trees

#### Features Used
The Random Forest uses 14 features:
- **User-modifiable features** (11): stars, useful, funny, cool, user_review_count, user_average_stars, is_elite, review_length, user_friends, user_fans, user_compliment_count
- **Derived features** (3): sentiment polarity, number of sentences, average word length

#### Hyperparameters
- Number of trees: 100
- Maximum depth: None (trees can grow fully)
- Minimum samples per leaf: 1
- Random state: 42 (for reproducibility)

## Model Training and Evaluation

### Training Setup
- **Multi-modal**: Currently training on 283,830 balanced samples (141,915 deceptive + 141,915 genuine) from 500,000 reviews
- **Random Forest**: Previously trained on 5,638 samples
- Both models use 80/20 train/validation split
- Current training uses CUDA GPU acceleration for faster processing

### What is CUDA?
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is NVIDIA's parallel computing platform and programming model that enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). In machine learning:
- **GPU Acceleration**: GPUs have thousands of cores optimized for parallel processing, making them much faster than CPUs for matrix operations common in deep learning
- **Training Speed**: What would take hours on CPU can complete in minutes on GPU
- **Memory**: GPUs have dedicated high-bandwidth memory for faster data transfer
- **Current Setup**: Training is running on CUDA-enabled GPU with batch processing for optimal performance
